## interactive terminal project

The Challenge of this assignment is working within the limited knowledge I have.  
Origiinally, I had planned to design an escape room in which the player had the option to interact with  
a list of objects in a space and find a key.  

Without any function to return to the start of the program, the player could only choose a limited number of objects for the length of code.  
I unfortunately learned this the hard way as I was days into the code.
