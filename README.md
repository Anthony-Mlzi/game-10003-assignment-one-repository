# Draft One

The Challenge of this assignment is working within the limited knowledge I have.  
Origiinally, I had planned to design an escape room in which the player had the option to interact with  
a list of objects in a space and find a key.  

Without any function to return to the start of the program, the player could only choose a limited number of objects for the length of code.  
I unfortunately learned this the hard way as I was days into the code.

My first draft was an escape room game:

In this game, you were meant to solve the room like a riddle, using the relationship between objects to create a solution; Such as using a torch to burn a rope holding a door shut.  

However, without loops, this idea was not going to be feasible, In order for the player to put the puzzle together, they needed to be able to return from their choices.  

I needed the a game in which the player could not return from their choices, a game above moving forward and never backward. This inspired me to make a game of consequences, a surgery.

This first draft was meant to show the kind of variables I could work with for a theoretical game, which tasks, tool and choices the player would command.

But it was too straightforward, I found the design quite boring and I didn't think the player would enjooy it, so I briefly tried to make a sort of potion crafting simulator.

In my potion crafting draft, the player would combine two of any nine potions, twice over, and then combine the sum. But the number of possible combinations was quite daunting.

So I went back a step, the surgery idea was just missing something, so I spent more time putting notes down and designing a flowchart.

If I could give the player set stages, each with choices that had different impacts on the patients overall health, I could have a sort of score that the player was achieving.

Some ways into coding I decided to include another game mechanic built into the tool pick mechanic; a sort of medical questionaire. Players would need to now know the correct tool to use on the body part as well as a piece of trivia about said part.

I also channeled my macabre sense of humor into the game with an over-the-top English narrator and a collection of player outcomes that were quite ridiculous and gruesome.

Originally I had five tools and five stages.  
A Scalpel, a circsaw, a bonesaw, a hammer and hands.  
The skin, the ribs, the lungs, the stomach and the heart.  

But with this many options I ended up doubling the maximum required line of codes, I decided to cut down by removing the stomach and hammer, both of which I found to be the weakest part of the game.

With three stages of four choices, a health meter and three possible endings, it was time for playtesting.

Every student who played my game played it differently, some going for what they believed were the correct answers and others purposefully choosing the most incorrect answers.

Interestingly, every player took the trivia questions more seriously, pausing to recall what they may have learned from highschool biology.

I concluded playtesting and rechecked the formatting of the code before submitting the final project.
