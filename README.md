# Draft One

The Challenge of this assignment is working within the limited knowledge I have.  
Origiinally, I had planned to design an escape room in which the player had the option to interact with  
a list of objects in a space and find a key.  

Without any function to return to the start of the program, the player could only choose a limited number of objects for the length of code.  
I unfortunately learned this the hard way as I was days into the code.

My first draft was an escape room game:

In this game, you were meant to solve the room like a riddle, using the relationship between objects to create a solution; Such as using a torch to burn a rope holding a door shut.  

However, without loops, this idea was not going to be feasible, In order for the player to put the puzzle together, they needed to be able to return from their choices.  

I needed the a game in which the player could not return from their choices, a game above moving forward and never backward. This inspired me to make a game of consequences, a surgery.
